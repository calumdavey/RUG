Just adding to chat some resources I'd really recommend for learning R, if you are within the RStudio + Tidyverse paradigm:

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/
https://www.statlearning.com/ (not specific to Tidyverse, excellent as a practical open textbook walkthrough on various ML methods)
https://otexts.com/fpp2/

At some point I will probably compile the above into a running list on GitHub (like this one https://github.com/7j7j/lshtm-rd-resources), maybe we should set this up with RUsers group (https://github.com/lshtm-rug) and/or CHIL-R (LSHTM health economists') GitHub (https://github.com/LSHTM-CHIL)

Also really recommend peer learning resources like R Ladies London: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-london/

and similarly across R/Python/Julia etc: https://www.meetup.com/London-Data-Science-ODSC/
