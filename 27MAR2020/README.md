# RUG meeting 27 Mar 2020
Amy MacDougall, Carl Pearson, Julia Shen, Lauren Bell, Martina Cusinato, and Calum Davey presented their plots.

Carl's materials can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/cabp_LSHTM/denvax). Particularly, in the R/zzz.R file (ignore the code surrounding the functions - that's just to deal with the code only optionally loading).
 
and in the inst/extdata and inst/app folders.

Julia's materials can be found [here](https://github.com/7j7j/LSHTM-R-polar-plot)
